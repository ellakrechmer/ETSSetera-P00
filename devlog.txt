ellaK -- 2021-11-02\16:45
made a working sign up page; not sure if it inserts it into table (will check) but doesn't crash anymore

shyneC -- 2021-11-03\8:40
allowed the user to stay logged in (w/ session)

imported redirect and made the welcome page's route "/loggedin". login info will no longer be shown in the URL in the welcome page. when logged out, user will be directed to the "/" route.

seanG, patrickG -- 2021-11-04\22:00
create class for database, which makes code much simpler, readable, and debuggable (if need be).

shyneC -- 2021-11-05\8:40
added the error of different usernames

ellaK -- 2021--11-06\21:55
-fixed link from login page to signup; now, you can successfully sign up and go to the response page
-fixed login so that it goes to \login instead of \signup (mistake from classwork testing)
-fixed signup so that confirming password works properly
-made login successfully check for existing username+password combinations and only login if both are correct
[long story short: login and signup are working now!!]

seanG, patrickG --2021-11-07\13:42
-created BlogTable class which will be implemented in __init__.py. API intended to make database operations more readable, debuggable, and easier to implement.
-BlogTable has entry number (rowid), username, blogText(content), and keywords.
-added temporary folder for testing code, which shows that BlogTable class works, feel free to add more testing code into the folder. Will be deleted before project is submitted.
-Right now will add title into blogTable constructor.
